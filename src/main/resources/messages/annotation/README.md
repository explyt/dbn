**Root Location for NLS-Related Annotations (e.g., `@NonNls`)**  
This provides support for annotating library classes with NLS-related qualifications.

Classes, methods, parameters, and fields can be annotated to exclude them from IntelliJ NLS inspections (e.g., "Hardcoded string literal"). This is achieved by adding the appropriate `annotations.xml` definitions in the corresponding package subdirectory.
